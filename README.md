# 🚗 Tesla-Inspired SwiftUI App

A beautifully designed **SwiftUI-based prototype** of a Tesla-style mobile application. This project focuses on delivering a smooth, modern UI experience with features such as **car controls**, **custom media player**, **charging screen**, **valet mode**, and **map annotations** — all built natively in SwiftUI using AVFoundation and SF Symbols.
